Introduction
This blog web application is built using a combination of modern technologies to provide a robust, efficient, and scalable platform for managing and presenting blog content. The application leverages asynchronous programming, MongoDB as a NoSQL database, Express.js for server-side development, and various middleware for enhanced functionality.

Key Technologies
Backend Technologies:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying server-side logic.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
Redis: In-memory data store used for caching and temporary storage.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Secure authentication and information exchange.
Bcrypt: Password-hashing function for secure password storage.
Middleware and Tools:
Morgan: Middleware for logging HTTP requests.
cookieParser: Middleware for parsing client-side cookies.
MethodOverride: Middleware enabling the usage of all HTTP methods.
MongoStore: Session store for Express applications.
Pagination: Technique for breaking down large data sets for improved user experience.
Frontend Technology:
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Template engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
Getting Started
To set up the blog web application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/johnson-oragui/Blog-Webstack-Portfolio-Project.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Set up MongoDB and Redis servers.
Configure environment variables for sensitive data.
Start the application: npm run dev

Architecture Overview
The architecture follows a Node.js and Express.js-based server communicating with a MongoDB database. Redis is utilized for caching, and JWT ensures secure user authentication. The frontend is rendered using EJS templates.

Important Concepts:
Asynchronous Programming: Enhances performance by handling asynchronous operations efficiently.
Model Schemas: Define data structure and constraints for MongoDB collections.
Document Aggregations: Process and transform data within MongoDB.
Document References or Embedding: Organize and relate data within MongoDB collections.
Authorization: Restrict access to certain resources based on user permissions.
Dependencies
List of key dependencies:

express: Web application framework for Node.js.
mongodb: Official MongoDB driver for Node.js.
redis: Redis client for Node.js.
jsonwebtoken: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
bcrypt: Library for secure password hashing.
ejs: Embedded JavaScript template engine.
Refer to package.json for a complete list of dependencies.
